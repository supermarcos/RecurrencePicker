RecurrencePickerDialog and Parser
=================================

![image](https://github.com/supermarcos/RecurrencePicker/raw/master/screenshot.jpeg)

This project is for the people who want to display a recurrence dialog for calendars/schedulers/agendas.
It shows a dialog with enough features to create a RRULE string for GoogleCalendar API or others who follows the RRULE standards.

I used these next repos for the sample:
https://github.com/dwivedi/ExtendedCalendarView
https://github.com/android/platform_packages_apps_calendar


Please, feel free to pinch the code, improve it, share and spread it and, of course enjoy, sing and dance.

Happy coding!
:)
